# Online library & framework updates

- **When using external libraries or frameworks**, always perform a quick web search (prefer official docs, release notes, or README) to:
  - Confirm the **latest stable version** and any **breaking changes**.
  - Check for **new or preferred APIs** that may replace older patterns.
  - Verify **usage examples** that match the target language and environment.

- **Before writing or updating code that depends on a library**:
  - Look up the library’s **current documentation** for the specific feature or API.
  - Prefer solutions that align with **current best practices** shown in recent docs.

- **If the project already pins dependency versions** (e.g., in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or lockfiles):
  - Still consult the **latest docs**, but ensure final code remains **compatible with the pinned version**.

- **If conflicting information appears between local code and online docs**:
  - Explain the difference (e.g., “v2 vs v3 API”) and choose the approach that:
    - Respects the project’s existing version constraints, and
    - Moves toward **modern, supported APIs** when feasible.
